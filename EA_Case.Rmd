This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

n <- 200
lambda <- .5
x <- pnorm(n, mean = lambda, sd = 1)
ptk <- c(14000, 8000, 14000, 8000, 16000, 14000, 11000, 10500, 13000, 5000, 15500, 15000)
pts = seq(0, max(ptk), by = 1)
plot(ecdf(ptk), col="black")
# lines(pts, pnorm(pts, mean = 12000, sd = 3500),col="red")
lines(pts, pnorm(pts, mean = 12000, sd = 3500),col="red")

plot(pts,pbeta(pts,shape1 = 5, shape2 = 6), col = "green")
lines(pts, pexp(pts,rate = lambda), col = "red")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
